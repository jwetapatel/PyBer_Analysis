# PyBer_Analysis
Using Matplotlib library

# Overview of the analysis:

 In this project we helped Omar to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type by using Pandas and Matplotlib,
 we conducted the analyses and visualization of the ride-sharing data very similar to Uber. we had two datasets: ride data with location, date and fare for every ride.  The goal was to compare quantity and fares of rides in every city type: urban, suburban and rural; create clear visualization with matplotlib library and provide recommendation to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

 So we Analyzed foloowing data.
 
 - A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
 - A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type


# Resources

Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

Software: Python 3.7.4, Pandas 0.25.2, Matplotlib 3.1.1, Jupyter Notebook









 
 you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
 I conducted the analyses and visualization of the ride-sharing data very similar to Uber. I had two datasets: ride data with location, date and fare for every ride, and city data which describes type of city and number of drivers. The goal was to compare quantity and fares of rides in every city type: urban, suburban and rural; create clear visualization with matplotlib library and provide recommendation to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

During the analysis I’ve used Jupyter Notebook, pandas and matplotlib libraries.
